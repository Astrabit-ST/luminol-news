bonkers bananas[^1]!!!

Here's how you can make **BADASS** and _italian_ text[^2].

wowie zowie!

Will ~~strikethrough~~ and **underlines** work? We'll see...

|                  | ASCII                           | HTML                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`             | 'Isn't this fun?'             |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`             | "Isn't this fun?"             |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |

Now for code blocks and `inline snippets`!

```
banana
```

```js
const greet = (person) => {
  console.log(person ? `Hey there, ${person}!` : "Hi");
};

greet("you");
greet();
```
